In this workshop, students will apply the theoretical concepts discussed earlier in the week to their own research. Before the workshop, students should complete an exercise designed to analyze the mechanisms in their field. During the session, they will use their reflections to foster discussion and gain deeper insights into operationalizing these mechanisms. This hands-on approach will help students critically evaluate different theoretical perspectives and develop robust research strategies.
