In this foundational module, students will be introduced to the goals and expectations of the course. This will begin with an introduction to philosophy of science, followed by delving into considerations of philosophy in science. Then, we will explore why scientists should care about philosophy and what barriers we face in practicing philosophy in science. Finally, students will be introduced to the template of assumptions that gives the course its structure–a scaffold that we will fill in and build on in each new module with the end result being an outline of each student’s theoretical framework for their research. In essence, we introduce the question–what are we even doing in our science?–and provide a roadmap for answering it.

To understand what we’re doing, it helps to have an understanding of what science is. In this foundational module, we’ll be delving into the core question in philosophy of science: what is science? We’ll explore the range of topics within this overarching inquiry to get a handle on what’s at stake in this question, including theoretical considerations in empirical research: philosophy in science. Then, we’ll identify potential challenges that scientists face in embracing the full scope of our field and examine how these challenges influence theoretical considerations.
