In this workshop, students will reflect on the purpose of their research phenomena, considering whether the purpose is intrinsic or extrinsic. Prior to the workshop, students are expected to complete the exercise, which involves critically evaluating the teleological aspects of their phenomena. During the session, students will share their reflections, and guiding discussions on how understanding purpose can bridge their metaphysical and mechanistic assumptions. This collaborative exploration will deepen students' appreciation of the role of teleology in scientific inquiry.
