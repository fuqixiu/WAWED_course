This week, we focus on the theoretical virtues that determine the robustness and quality of scientific theories. Students will explore how empirical data often fail to resolve disputes between competing theoretical frameworks, necessitating an examination of the underlying virtues that guide theory selection. By the end of the module, students will understand the key qualities that make a theory scientifically valuable and how to apply these criteria to their own research.

In this lecture, we will explore the concept of theoretical virtues—features that define a good scientific theory. We will examine classic and contemporary perspectives on these virtues, such as simplicity, explanatory power, and coherence, and discuss how they help arbitrate between competing theories. The lecture will include discussions on Ockham’s Razor and Sober’s interpretations of different kinds of simplicity. By the end of the session, students will gain insights into how these virtues influence scientific debates and theory development.
