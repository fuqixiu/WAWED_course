For this initial practical workshop of the course, students begin the essential process of mapping out their research through a structured Table of Assumptions. This exercise is designed to help each participant explicitly articulate the foundational assumptions that underpin their scientific investigations. Students can take their first stab at the table between the theoretical and practical sections of this week, so that what theyâ€™ve filled out can be shared in class during the workshop section. Each subsequent module will elaborate on a domain in the table, so we will keep coming back to it until the end of the course. This table summarizes domains of theoretical assumptions for their scientific framework which shapes the scientific theory each student uses.
