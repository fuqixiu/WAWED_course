This week, we explore the mechanisms underlying scientific phenomena, focusing on how different assumptions about these mechanisms shape scientific theories. Students will examine how scientific phenomena arise and the methods used to observe and measure these processes. The module will also address the challenges of studying living phenomena, particularly in the context of emergence and complexity. By the end of the week, students will have a deeper understanding of how to operationalize and investigate the mechanisms underlying their research topics.

In this lecture, we will delve into the concept of mechanisms in science, exploring how different theoretical assumptions about these mechanisms influence scientific explanations. We will discuss classic and contemporary views on the mechanisms of phenomena, examining how they arise, function, and can be observed and measured. Special emphasis will be placed on the unique challenges posed by living phenomena, such as the concept of emergence and the debate over whether complexity alone is sufficient to account for life. We will explore how these ideas impact the operationalization of scientific theories and the methodologies employed in empirical research. By understanding these underlying mechanisms, students will be better equipped to develop and refine their scientific investigations. Finally, we will hear from Dr. John Morrison on how philosophical considerations can influence our understanding and study of mechanism.
