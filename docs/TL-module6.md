In this final module, we will explore alternative conceptualizations of science and consider new directions for scientific inquiry. While this course has focused on certain philosophical positions, it is important to acknowledge that there are diverse perspectives on what science is and how it can be conducted. Students will be introduced to various approaches, including neurophenomenology and the role of subjectivity in science, and will discuss ways to overcome barriers to theoretical discussion and change within neuroscience. This module encourages students to think beyond traditional frameworks and embrace innovative approaches to scientific research, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic scientific community.

In this lecture, students will be introduced to alternative philosophical perspectives on science that challenge conventional methodologies. We will consider the concept of science being atheoretical, where empirical data is prioritized over theoretical frameworks. The lecture will also cover neurophenomenology, which integrates subjective experiences with objective neuroscience to provide a holistic understanding of the mind and brain. Additionally, we will explore the role of the self in scientific inquiry, questioning how perception and agency can be incorporated into our science and influence research outcomes. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate these perspectives and consider how they might integrate these alternative approaches into their own scientific practice. Finally, Dr. Nedah Nemati will share the case of sleep, illustrating how philosophical considerations can shape scientific understanding and research methodologies.
