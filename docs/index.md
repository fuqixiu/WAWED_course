# Philosophy in Science (Fall 2024)
“There’s no such thing as philosophy-free science. There’s only science whose
philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination.”
- from _Darwin’s Dangerous Idea_ by Daniel Dennett 


**Instructors**: Dr. Daniela Schiller, Alessandra Yu, and Qi Xiu Fu, with guest speakers from Columbia University.

**Time**: Mondays & Thursdays 2:30 - 4:00 pm

**Location**: Hess Center for Science and Medicine 

**Format**: This course will be in-person only. Lecture and workshop materials will be made available online. 

**Overview**
This elective is ideal for motivated biomedical and neural science students who are interested in diving deeper into the theoretical foundations of their own research and science at large. If you've ever found yourself wondering, "What are we even doing in science?", this course is for you! This is a unique chance to refine your own research framework in a structured manner and among a community of like-minded scientists. 

**Description**
This course dives into the philosophical foundations of science, offering the opportunity to critically reflect on the theoretical underpinning of _your_ own research. Science is inherently laden with theory. Theory shapes the questions we ask and how we choose to answer them. Moreover, not all questions are empirical ones. What should we do when two theories equally account for the observed data? While much of science depends on methodological advancement, these theoretical decision points often precede significant scientific breakthroughs and, with enough theoretical pressure, culminate in a paradigm shift.
However, without rigorous theoretical care, uncontrolled proliferation of theories and frameworks without them converging can threaten to overwhelm the scientific landscape of any subfield–fragmenting it and impeding scientific progress. This applies to the life sciences in particular and even more so to biomedical and neural sciences sitting at their intersection, given their multiscale and cognitive aspects. In these burgeoning fields, both our descriptions of _what_ we study and our choices for _how_ we study our objects of inquiry are both diverse and heavily debated. Even deeper, our motivations for _why_ we study what we do and how we choose to study those phenomena are also diverse and rarely disclosed.
We invite you to embark on this theoretical journey through the most nuanced and foundational, yet slippery facets of science. By engaging with theoretical discussion and practical application, we hope you will emerge not only with a better understanding of your place in the field as a scientist, but with enhanced clarity into your own research framework.
- This course is designed for graduate-level students in the biomedical and neural sciences who are developing foundational thinking for their research interests. We encourage students to actively discuss and consult with their Principal Investigators (PIs) on the application of the topics and issues raised in this course to their own research, particularly between lecture and practical workshop components in order to get the most out of the course structure. Our aim is to foster a deep interest in the philosophical underpinnings of science, highlighting the inherent role of theory in empirical research as well as the dynamics of scientific progress–and at times, stagnation. By implementing these concepts in concrete exercises made relevant to each student, we hope that theoretical discussion beyond the classroom is enriched and takes further root in the lab, where theory truly meets practice.
- Finally, this course is both an experimental and an evolving process. We value iteration and continuous  improvement, particularly as we consider offering this course in future years. Please do provide feedback or share your thoughts on your experiences in integrating the course content with your research.

**Objectives**
- Identify and describe theoretical **debates** in your own subfield
- Reflect on your **motivations** for the choices you make in your science
- Outline **assumptions** shaping your own research
- Interpret neighboring **subfields** despite the differences in jargon in the literature
- Address **barriers** to theoretical understanding, discussion, and change in everyday science

**Expectations**
This course consists of 8 modules, each 1 week long with two 1.5-hour sections.
Every week features a dual structure:
1. _Mondays_ are **theoretical lectures**, occasionally with guest instructors, paired with heavy discussion. (These guests would be well-established researchers themselves, joining us from beyond Sinai, whose topic of research is the theoretical focus of the module.)
2. _Thursdays_ are **practical workshops** focused on applying the principles of theoretical lecture to your own research with an opportunity to share with classmates and participating PIs.
**Active participation** is crucial for both segments throughout the course as both are designed to be highly interactive. This course aims to empower each student to build mastery in the theoretical nuances of their own research. It is up to every student to truly apply the principles learned in the theoretical portion not only in the practical workshops, but in their own lab research and broader scientific careers.

**Grading**: This is a P/F course. The course is considered passed based on attendance and participation.

**Requirements**
- **Attendance** and **participation** are required (**40%**). Students will be allowed up to one excused absence. A personal electronic device should be brought to class for in-device polls and exercises.
- All **readings** must be completed every week prior to the theoretical lecture.
- All selected **exercises** must be completed prior to the end of the course.
- The **project**, consisting of exercises (**30%**) and a reflection (**10%**), must be submitted at the end.
- All **feedback** forms must be completed following each week (**20%**).

**Project**
**Deadline:** Friday, November 22, 2024
The final project will have 2 components:
1. All your **exercises**, including a table outlining your theoretical assumptions for your research.
2. A 1-page **reflection** on your experience in this course and how it impacts your research going forward.
