# **practical** Reflections

**Instructors**: Dr. Daniela Schiller & Alessandra Yu & Qi Xiu Fu   

**Time**: Thursday, Sept 26, 2024      

**Exercise (select 1)**   
- Reflect on all your reasons for being in neuroscience and studying what youâ€™re interested in.
- Track the history of motivations in your subfield (i.e., why ask a particular qu), either:
    - Summarize a short history of the motivations in your subfield and reflect; OR
    - Identify a historical review and reflect on the implicit motivations of your subfield.
- Trace your academic lineage while highlighting the contextual motivations influencing each researcher that came before you. Use [Neurotree](https://neurotree.org/neurotree/) to see your neuroscience family tree.   
- [Weekly feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXfuK-Nf1wu9lTHe5GZlyCSYQvdyoYcEFPLA5ZC3sMrf_CmQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) 

In this practical workshop, students will apply the concepts discussed in the theoretical lecture to their own research motivations. Through the completion of a reflective exercise, students will explore the underlying reasons for their research focus and how historical and contextual factors have shaped these motivations. During the workshop, students will share their completed exercises to spur discussion. This session is designed to deepen students' understanding of the philosophical and pragmatic drivers of their scientific inquiries, fostering a more introspective and comprehensive approach to their work.
