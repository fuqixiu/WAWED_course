This lecture dives into the essential why-questions that underpin all scientific inquiry, specifically examining the motivations behind studying certain phenomena in neuroscience. We will explore how these motivations are not just personal choices but are often deeply influenced by the broader context in which the research occurs. This module will help students recognize the complex interplay between individual interests and the historical, cultural, and academic contexts that shape these interests.

In this lecture, we will explore the motivations driving scientific inquiry and how these motivations shape research methods and outcomes. We will discuss the pragmatic aspects of science, focusing on how the context of research affects the questions asked and the explanations provided. The lecture will highlight the role of philosophy in understanding scientific motivation and pragmatism, delving into the why-questions that underpin research. We will also examine biases stemming from local research traditions, practical observation methods, and audience interests. By the end, students will gain insights into the philosophical and pragmatic challenges influencing their research.
