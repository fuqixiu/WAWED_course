This week, we delve into the nature of scientific phenomena and the metaphysical assumptions that underpin them. As scientific communities grow, divergent assumptions about what constitutes a phenomenon can lead to theoretical divisions. Students will explore how different academic communities define and approach phenomena, shaping their research questions and methodologies. By the end of the module, students will have a clearer understanding of how to identify and frame the phenomena they study.

In this lecture, we will examine the philosophical concept of phenomena and how different assumptions about their nature can influence scientific theories. We will discuss the metaphysical foundations of scientific phenomena, focusing on how different academic communities define and study these constructs. The lecture will explore key philosophical literature on scientific explanation and the abstraction of phenomena, providing students with a framework to understand and articulate the phenomena central to their research. Additionally, we will highlight an example of a phenomenon where philosophical considerations significantly altered scientific understanding through the insights of our guest speaker, Dr. Paul Linton.
