In this final workshop, students will reflect on how their revised scientific frameworks influence their writing and communication strategies. Prior to the workshop, students are expected to complete an exercise that involves orienting a reader in their scientific writing, whether in the first paragraph of their own work or a review. During the session, students will share their approaches and discuss how their frameworks guide the way they present and communicate their research. Additionally, this session will gather valuable feedback from students about their course experience, aiming to improve future iterations of the course.
